This is a very simple project to demo building backend apps with
webpack. To use:

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp run`

The latest version implements everything in [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part III](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-III), allowing hot-patching of functions. This is also available on the frontend, so we've somewhat outgrown the name of this repo.

This is meant to along with my posts. Each post corresponds to a branch:

* [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part I](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-I) - part1
* [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part II](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-II) - part2a and part2b
* [Live Editing with Webpack: Part III](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-III) - part3 (or master)
